        <P>%(name)s is a simple open source todo manager to manage personal 
        tasks and todo lists. It grew out of my frustration that well-known 
        task managers, such as those provided with Outlook or Lotus Notes, do
        not provide facilities for composite tasks. Often, tasks and
        other things todo consist of several activities. %(name)s is
        designed to deal with composite tasks.</P>
        <P>Currently, %(name)s is at version %(version)s. I use it on a daily
        basis, but there are still a lot of features missing. If there's

        <P>%(name)s currently (%(version)s) has the following features:
        <UL>
            <LI>Creating, editing, and deleting tasks and subtasks.
            <LI>Tasks have a subject, description, priority, start date, 
            due date, a completion date and an optional reminder.
            <LI>Tasks can be viewed as a list or as a tree.
            <LI>Tasks can be sorted by all task attributes, e.g. subject,
            budget, budget left, due date, etc.
            <LI>Several filters to e.g. hide completed tasks or view
            only tasks that are due today. Filters can be managed through
            the filter side bar.
            <LI>Task status depends on its subtask and vice versa. E.g. if 
            you mark the last uncompleted subtask as completed, the parent 
            task is automatically marked as completed too.
            <LI>Tasks can be assigned to user-defined categories. 
            <LI>Settings are persistent and saved automatically. The
            last opened file is loaded automatically when starting
            %(name)s.
            <LI>Tracking time spent on tasks. Tasks can have a budget. 
            Time spent can be viewed by individual effort period, by day, 
            by week, and by month.
            <LI>The %(name)s file format (.tsk) is XML. 
            <LI>Tasks can be exported to HTML. Effort can be exported to
            XML and iCalendar/ICS format.
            <LI>Tasks and effort can be printed. When printing, Task
            Coach print the information that is visible in the current
            view, including any filters and sort order. 
        </UL>
        <H3>Missing features</H3>
        <P>The main feature that is currently missing is the possibility to
        assign or be assigned tasks to/by other people via the 
        iCalendar standard.
        </P>

        <H4>Instructions for translators</H4>
        <P>I would welcome translations in additional languages.
        Please be aware that, next to providing the initial translation,
        you will be expected to keep your translation up to date as new
        versions of %(name)s are released.</P>
        <P>To create a new translation, please follow these steps:
        <OL>
            <LI>Install a gettext catalogs editor. I recommend 
            <A HREF="http://www.poedit.org/">poEdit</A>. 
            <LI>Download the message catalog:
            <A HREF="messages.pot"><TT>messages.pot</TT></A>. This file
            contains all text strings to be translated.
            <LI>Rename <TT>messages.pot</TT> into <TT>yourlanguage.po</TT>.
            <LI>Start poEdit and load <TT>yourlanguage.po</TT> and 
            create the translation. Please make sure you understand how
            <A HREF="http://docs.python.org/lib/typesseq-strings.html">Python
            string formatting</A> works since %(name)s uses both the regular
            '%%s' type of string formatting as well as the mapping key form 
            '%%(mapping_key)s'.
            <LI>Mail me the resulting <TT>yourlanguage.po</TT> file. I will
            include it into %(name)s.
        </OL>
        When a new release of %(name)s is ready, I will make the new
        <A HREF="messages.pot"><TT>messages.pot</TT></A> available here 
        so you can update your <TT>.po</TT> file. This is when using poEdit 
        will really pay off, because it will mark for you which strings have
        been added or changed and require your attention.</P>

pages['faq'] = \
'''    <H3>Frequently asked questions</H3>
    <P><I>I upgraded to a new version and now I cannot load my %(name)s file. It
    says: "Error loading <myfile>.tsk. Are you sure it is a %(name)s file?".
    I'm sure the file's ok. What next?</I></P>
    <P>Remove your TaskCoach.ini file and try again. Sometimes errors in
    loading old settings files will cause %(name)s to barf on .tsk files that
    are just fine. The TaskCoach.ini file is located in C:\Documents and
    Settings\&lt;yourname&gt;\Application Data\TaskCoach if you're on Windows 
    and in /home/&lt;yourname&gt;/.TaskCoach if you're on Linux.</P>
    <P><I>Can I track effort for more than one task at the same
    time?</I></P>
    <P>Yes, when you are tracking effort for a task, select the second
    task, right-click and select 'New effort...'. When you don't fill in
    an end-time, effort for that second task will be tracked too.</P>
    <P><I>I'm on Linux, using a window manager with virtual desktops. If
    I switch (back) to the virtual desktop where %(name)s was running, I can 
    no longer find it. Where did %(name)s go?</I></P>
    <P>%(name)s is probably minimized. Look for the little %(name)s icon
    in the system tray, click on it with your right mouse button and
    select 'Restore'.  Apparently, switching between virtual desktops is
    implemented by sending a minimize event to applications.
    Unfortunately, %(name)s has no way to distinguish between minimize
    events caused by the window manager and minimize events caused by
    the user minimizing the window. If you run into this issue, you may
    want to change the setting 'Hide main window when iconized', see
    'Edit' -> 'Preferences'.</P>
'''

pages['roadmap'] = \
'''    <h3>%(name)s roadmap</h3>
    <p>My aim for %(name)s is to be a personal assistent that helps with
    the daily chores of life: remembering things to do, registering
    hours spent on projects, taking notes, etc. It should also be as
    intuitive as possible for users to deal with and not require any technical
    knowledge.</p>
    <p>Currently, %(name)s knows about two domain concepts: tasks and
    effort. Other domain concepts that might be added include note
    and contact person.</p>
    <p>In the long run, it might be worthwile to allow
    users to add their own concepts. So, for example, if you want to keep
    a list of books to read you could define a book concept and accompanying
    fields like author, title, isbn, read/unread status, etc. That would
    also need the file format to be very flexible.</p>
    <p>Anyway, this is it for now, I'll add more as soon as my thoughts
    on the subject crystalize into a more coherent picture of the future 
    direction for %(name)s.</p>

pages['devinfo'] = \
'''    <h3>Information for developers</h3>
    <p>Here's some information for developers that either want to hack
    on %(name)s or reuse code.</p>
    <h4>Coding style</h4>
    <p>Class names are StudlyCaps. Method names are camelCase, except
    for wxPython methods that are called or overridden because those are
    StudlyCaps. At first I thought that was ugly, a mixture of two
    styles. But it turned out to be quite handy, since you can easily
    see whether some method is a wxPython method or not.</p>
